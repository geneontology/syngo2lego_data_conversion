In the parietal cortex (A–C) cytoplasmic labeling was frequently observed in large to small dendritic pro files (d in A) throughout the cortical layers (see light microscopical results). In synaptic areas, caldendrin immunoreactivity in different cortical layers was exclusively localised postsynaptically (see arrows) in asymmetrical glutamatergic synapses. Labeled synapses (arrows) were either large, complex synapses (A and B), or smaller spine synapses (C). Note that immunopositive  synapses  are  found  in  close  neighbourhood  together  with  unlabeled  synapses  of  the  same  morphological  type  (marked  by asterisks).  (D)  In  immunopositive  putative  interneuron  dendrites  (receiving  several  asymmetrical  synapses)  the  DAB  reaction  product  displayed — in contrast to all other examples shown—no tendency of being distributed toward the postsynaptic densities asterisks). (E) Occasionally,  two  synapses  on  the  same  target  structure  and  in  close  neighbourhood  were  observed  to  be  immunopositive  and  immunonegative,\nrespectively, for caldendrin. The survey micrograph (G) of caldendrin-IR in the cortex shows that in close neighbourhood to the relatively rarely occurring immunopositive synapses (arrow) many immunonegative synapses (asterisks) can be found. The appearance (staining) of postsynaptic densities in immunonegative synapses (A, B, D, E, G) was similar when comparing them to material obtained from negative controls, which were not incubated with the primary antibody (F)."

Two conditions were studied: (1) when the onset of EPSPs was about 20 ms after postsynaptic spiking, the EPSC amplitude of both stimulated (homosynaptic) and non-stimulated (heterosynaptic) inputs showed a persistent reduction following the correlated activation (LTD protocol) and (2) when the onset of EPSPs was about 5 ms before postsynaptic spiking, the EPSC amplitude of the homosynaptic input showed a persistent increase in amplitude whereas the one of the heterosynaptic input was not affected (LTP protocol).\n\nFunctional blockade of IP3R1 by postsynaptic loading of a monoclonal antibody against IP3R1 or genetic deletion of IP3R1 using IP3R1-deficient mice impacted both conditions: when studying LTD (1) lacking IP3R1 function led to a conversion of homosynaptic LTD to LTP and eliminated heterosynaptic LTD. When studying LTP (2) a significant enhancement of homosynaptic LTP was observed, resulting in even higher potentiation. Therefore, IP3R1 presents a role in regulating Ca2+ release from internal stores in the postsynaptic neuron, which can control polarity and magnitude of postsynaptic plasticity."

Flot1 is shown to mediate PKC-triggered internalization and Amphiphysin-induced reverse transport of DA in primary DA neurons. According to SynGO guidelines this does not have to happen AT the synapse; BPs are included when relevant for synaptic function. Without evidence shown this is implied by the authors \"Plasmalemmal neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) regulate the level of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA) and glutamate, after their release at brain synapses\". Another point of doubt is the 're-' part of the term 'reuptake'. No experiments are shown in a synaptic context and secretion from synapses and consecutive re-uptake are not shown in the paper. I have allowed this under an IC evidence type: the justification here is that whatever Dopamine is around cells that this has to be secreted by a synapse at some time."

This is inhibited by pep2m, a peptide that inhibits NSF\/GluR2 interactions (Figure 1). The effect does not require exocytotic insertion of GluRs, since Botox B is unable to inhibit the effect (Figure 1D), and there is no increase in the surface or total level or GluR2 (Figure 3E). Using synaptosomes, it is shown that PKM-zeta dependent LTP does lead to a increase in synaptic GluR2 and GluR3, and that this is blocked by pep2m and a ZIP (a inhibitor with some specificity to PKM-zeta). It is thus concluded that PKM-zeta increases AMPAR responses by recruiting extrasynaptic GluRs to the PSD.\n\nLing et.al. 2006 demonstrates that PKM zeta-induced potentiation requires an increase in the number of receptors, not an increase in receptor conductance.\n\nIt should be noted that PKM-zeta has long been suspected to be essential for postsynaptic LTP, but that this is subject on an ongoing debate.

(Figure 1)\n-PI3K activation increases PKC lambda auto-phosphorylation and EPSC amplitudes. This is inhibited by PKC-lambda shRNA, and an inhibitor (Myr-aPKC-PS, more commonly known as ZIP) with some specificity to PKC-lambda. (Figure 2).\n-PI3K activation leads to increased surface expression of GluRs, which is inhibited by Myr-aPKC-PS (Figure 3C-F).\n-PI3K activation leads to increased mEPSC amplitudes, which can be blocked by PKC-lambda shRNA and Myr-aPKC-PS (Figure 3G-H).\n\nIt should be noted that at the concentration used, Myr-aPKC-PS also strongly inhibits PKC-zeta (see Figure 1D and Tsokas et al 2016). Thus, in several assays in this publication, it cannot be excluded that observed effects are mediated by PKC-zeta. The role of PKC-lambda in LTP is debated and likely involves an interplay with PKC-zeta expression (Tsokas et al 2016)."

Knockdown of both CrkI\/II and Crk-L was necessary to induce a significant effect in postsynaptic AChR cluster formation, an effect that was partially rescued by overexpression of CrkL (Hallock et  al., 2015). Transgenic mice lacking CrkL and CrkI\/II in myotubes show neonatal lethality and study of their embryonic neuromuscular synapses reveal a lower number of synapses which resulted in a low level of innervated myofibers, decreased synaptic size and decreased number of synaptic AChRs. Moreover, motor axons grow beyond AChR cluster. Overall, CrkL has a crucial role in neuromuscular pre- and postsynaptic differentiation and its absence can be compensated by CrkI\/II."

                        "rationale": "This publication provides evidence that Piccolo is involved in presynaptic vesicle clustering. In neuronal cultures of Piccolo knockout mice, with additional knockdown of Bassoon, there is a reduction in the in the number of vesicles per synaptic bouton (Figure 4G-H). There also appears to be a reduction of the number of docked vesicles (Figure 4L, N), but it unclear whether this is a direct effect, or caused indirectly by a reduction in vesicle clustering. Knockout of Piccolo alone had no effect on vesicle clustering or docking, suggesting that Piccolo and Bassoon may be redundant in this.\n\nThe data presented in this paper should be considered with some caution. The genetic manipulation to delete Piccolo is a hypomorph, meaning that some Piccolo splice variants are still expressed (Waites et.al. 2011). In addition, due to the very large size of Piccolo, available techniques make it difficult to accurately measure Piccolo levels in cell lysates. Waites et.al. also shows that Piccolo regulates the assembly of presynaptic F-actin, which is in line with phenotype in vesicle clustering."

Labeled dendrites often formed synaptic contacts with unlabeled axon terminals, and most of these synapses were asymmetric (Fig. 3A,D,E). Cav1.2 was observed less frequently in dendritic spines where the peroxidase reaction product was observed mostly in the cytoplasm or regions of the plasma membrane away from the postsynaptic density (Fig. 4A–D).\n\nThe pre-embedding immunogold method was used to localize Cav1.2 more discretely. Immunogold particles were mostly localized in the cytoplasm of dendrites but a signiﬁcant portion of the labeling was also associated with the plasma membrane (Fig.7A,B), particularly in small dendrites. In dendritic spines of CA1 and CA3 neurons immunogoldparticles were predominantly intracellular (Table 2).\n\n21\/6\/2017 Pim\n- I regard the predominant intracellular localization of Cav21 in these preparation as reflecting a non-canonical localization for this protein (protein synthesis, inactive pool) and I refrain from annotation of this localization."

Actb LoxP\/LoxP were used as controls.    \n\nMouse hippocampal cultures were prepared using Actb LoxP\/LoxP mice.

                        "rationale": "Whole cell patch recordings of P7-P10 calyxes at 22-24 oC were given a 20 ms depolarization from -80 mV to +10 mV.   The initial rate of decay of the capacitance change was significantly slower (~33% of control) in the Actin, beta KO suggesting a slower rate of endocytosis following vesicle fusion (Fig 2. A-C).    Similar results were observed when the stimulus was changed to a 20 action potential equivalent stimulus (Fig. 2 D-F), performed at 34-37 oC (Fig. 2 G) and in older mice (P13-P14) (Fig. 2 H).\n\nHippocampal neurons were cultured from the Actb LoxP\/LoxP mice transfected with Synaptophysin-pHluorin2X (SypH) with or without a Cre containing plasmid (Fig. 6 A and D).  SypH can be used to study vesicle recycling as it is non-fluorescent in relatively low pH environment of vesicles but is fluorescent in the higher pH extracellular environment.  Upon stimulation the decay of fluorescence was significantly slower than the control (Fig. 6 E-G).  This fluorescence was quenchable by a low pH solution applied externally indicating it was not a deficit in vesicle reacidification, but instead suggesting that the vesicles had not been endocytosed (Fig. 6H).  This effect was rescued by transfecting Actb in the KO cultures (Fig 7 A,B) but was not rescued by a version of Actb that could not polymerize (Fig 7 E,F).  Taken together this data suggests that Actin, beta is important for endocytosis.      \n\n."

After purification by CsC1 gradient centrifugation, the CaMKII-R(AB) transgene was purified away from vector sequences by digesting with BssHII. The 11.5 kb transgene was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified after electroelution using Elutip. Transgenic mice were generated by injecting the purified CaMKII-R(AB) transgene into pronuclei of BL6CBAF2\/J zygotes ( Hogan et al. 1994). Founders were backcrossed to C57BL\/6J mice. In some cases, because of breeding difficulties, mice from the R(AB)-2 transgenic line were crossed to B6CBAF1\/J animals. Mice were maintained and bred under standard conditions, consistent with NIH guidelines and approved by the IACUC. For genotyping, tail DNA was prepared ( Laird et al. 1991) and analyzed by Southern blotting (Sambrook et al. 1989) using a transgene-specific probe.",

The exact mechanism of action for PKAs is not understood, but requires the phosphorylation of AMPA receptors (Man et. al). PKA RIB is also involved in LTD (Brandon et.al. 1995), a process that regulates synaptic transmission through endocytosis of receptors."

Fbxl20 ubiquitinates and degrades the active zone protein Rim-1. Fbxl20 null mutant hippocampal neurons show increased spontaneous (mEPSC) frequency but not amplitude. The increased mEPSC frequency can be rescued to wild type levels by shRNA-mediated depletion of RIM-1.

Complexin-2 expression is downregulated in Calyx of Held terminals during development (Fig.11). At P21, Vglut-1 immunoreactivity does not colocalize with with Complexin-immunoreactivity in Complexin-1 KO mice (Fig.11C). Therefore, the immunoreactivity in wild-type Calyx of Held terminals at P21 must originate from the presence of Complexin-1 in the presynapse (Fig.1C).\nComplexin-1 immunreactivity is present in the somata of the MNTB principal neurons indicating also a postsynaptic localization. \n\nIHC was performed using an antibody (SySy, rabbit anti-Cplx-1\/2) that detects Complexin-1 and -2. Complexin-1 KO mice exhibit a loss of immunoreactivity in the somata of the MNTB principal neurons (Fig 11C) indicating the specificity of the antibody."

Rat hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with vGpH (a vesicular glutamate transporter-1 fused with pHluorin), and shRNA against SCAMP5. \nFigure 3 describes the endocytosis of SVs following 300 APs at 10 Hz, as monitored by following the vGpH signal, and demonstrates that endocytosis is slowed in the knock-down neurons. The effect can be rescued by the re-expression of SCAMP5.\nFigure 4 shows that the knock-down of SCAMP5 impairs endocytosis during stimulation. The neurons are stimulated by an AP train (300 APs at 10 Hz) to evaluate exocytosis, and, following recovery, by a train of 1200 APs at 10 Hz in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 (blocking SV reacidification following exocytosis), to evaluate the size of the recycling SV pool. This experiment demonstrates that the ratio of Endocytosis to exocytosis is lower in SCAMP5 KD neurons, suggesting that the fraction of the released SVs that undergoes endocytosis during the stimulation is lower than in the WT controls. The effect was fully rescued by the re-expression of SCAMP5."

A clear signal for VGLUT2 was observed in the total crude vesicular fraction, indicating that a subset of SVs in the fraction is expressing VGLUT2. In a sub-fraction of these SVs that was enriched for VGAT expression using immunoisolation, no signal for VGLUT2 was seen, which could be used as an indication for the specificity of the anti-VGLUT2 antibody."

The authors demonstrate in figure 2 that the CCVs are from the pre-synaptic compartment because they require osmotic shock to be released (because they are trapped in intact synaptosomes) whereas CCVs from other parts of the cell, including the post-synapse, would not require this treatment. In figure 4 the authors demonstrate by coomassie staining and western blot that the CCVs are highly enriched in CHC and multiple synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins, clearly indicating that CCVs are involved in SV recycling. Figure 7 uses immuno-electron microscopy to demonstrate that CCVs isolated from the pre-synaptic compartment and whole brain show very similar levels of staining for the SV protein synaptophysin, indicating that the major localization of CHC in brain is on CCVs that recycle SVs.\n\n22\/5\/2017 Pim\n- I agree with the expert.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 interacts with numerous components required for coating of clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs). The KO mice display an accumulation of CCVs in the presynaptic nerve terminal (fig 3) and recovery from synaptic depression following a strong stimulation (10Hz for 200 sec), an indication of SV recycling is strongly reduced in the KO mice.\n\n19\/6\/2017 Pim\n- Justifcation for selected term by expert: \"When synaptojanin is null the presynaptic nerve terminal accumulates CCVs (fig 3A\/C\/D). This not seen in the wt animals (fig 3B) and in fact one almost never observes CCVs in nerve terminals under wt conditions. This is because the clathrin coats are rapidly removed. This observation is entirely consistent with the fact that synaptojanin dephosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 and this PtdIns species is required for the clathrin coating of CCVs. The inference is that if the CCVs can not uncoat, then the SVs can not rejoin the SV functional pool.\""

The inclusion of BAPTA together with NCS-1 abolished the effect on the I-V curve, suggesting that the effect of NCS-1 on the Ca2+ channels is Ca2+-dependent. Specifically, the 10 to 90% rise time of the Ca2+ current is faster is calyces where NCS-1 is infused, indicating a direct effect on channel properties.\n\nFigure 2 demonstrates that the Ca2+ current facilitation caused by the perfusion of NCS-1 occludes the Ca2+ current facilitation that is usually observed during paired-pulse stimulation.\n\n6\/6\/2017 Pim\nA C-terminal peptide of NCS-1 that lacks the Ca-binding domain does not show the effect mentioned above, but blocks the effect of infused full length NCS-1 (Fig.4).

Double patch clamp experiments in paired neurons allow the comparison between presynaptic-transfected and presynaptic-non-transfected neurons. The paper essentially shows that presynaptic overexpression of NCS-1 leads to a switch to activity-dependent facilitation, from the otherwise observed depression in such cultures.\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates that in paired recordings from reciprocally connected neurons depression is seen in non-transfected presynaptic neurons whereas facilitation is seen at NCS-1 presynapticly transfected synapses.\nFigure 2 shows that even though the initial EPSC amplitudes are similar between controls and NCS-1-expressing neurons (Figure 2d), facilitation in seen in NCS-1-transfected synapses and depression in controls. This suggests that the effect of overexpression is on activity-dependent, rather than on basal transmitter release.\nFigure 4 shows that in NCS-1-transfected synapses continues facilitation is seen during high frequency stimulus trains."

Mouse retinal bipolar cells only express Complexin-3 and are therefore a good synapse to study the function of this protein (it is known that Complexins are partially redundant and can compensate for the loss of one isoform). \n\nThe study demonstrates a loss of phasic release (reduced EPSC amplitude; Fig.1), increase in spontaneous release (mEPSC frequency Fig.2+6) and asynchronous release (Fig. 7). Impaired phasic release was manifested both in a reduced functional RRP and in an increased EPSC latency. The diminished functional RRP likely resulted from the absence of a facilitatory effect of Cplx3 on Ca2+-dependentexocytosis (Fig. 4) rather than from physical vesicle depletion as assessed by electron microscopy (Fig. S1)."

Next, we examined whether LRRTM3 exhibits synapse-promoting activities by transfecting hippocampal neurons at 10 days in vitro (DIV10) with mVenus-fused L3L or L3S and immunostaining them at DIV14 for excitatory synaptic markers (VGLUT1 and Shank) and for inhibitory synaptic markers (GAD67 and gephyrin) (Figures 1H, 1I,\"\n\nFig. 2, the knockdown of LRRTM3 with shRNA reduces excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse numbers in DG granule neurons\nLiteral:\n\"To accomplish this, we transfected cultured DG neurons at DIV8 with vectors that express only EGFP (control) or coexpress EGFP with shRNAs against Lrrtm3 (L3 KD) or Lrrtm4 (L4 KD). We then immunostained the transfected neurons for VGLUT1 or GAD67 at DIV14 and quantified the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on dendrites of the transfected neurons (Figures 2A–2D). We found that the synapse loss induced by L3 or L4 KD was specific for excitatory synapses and not for inhibitory synapses (Figures 2A–2D). Strikingly, double KD of LRRTM3 and LRRTM4 (L3\/L4 DKD) did not further decrease the excitatory synapse numbers than KD of either protein alone, suggesting that both LRRTM3 and LRRTM4 may share common pathways in maintenance of excitatory synapse structure at DG neurons (Figures 2A–2D).\"\n\nFig. 4e,f, in lrrtm3-KO mice the development of excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses is mpaired in the DG\nLiteral\n\"A quantitative immunofluorescence analysis revealed a significant decrease in the intensity of VGLUT1 puncta in DG molecular layers (MML), but not in the CA1 stratum oriens (oriens), a phenotype similar to that observed in Lrrtm4-KO mice (Figures 4E and 4F; Siddiqui et al., 2013). In contrast, the intensity of GAD67 puncta was unchanged in both DG MML and CA1 oriens (Figures 4E and 4F). We next analyzed dendritic spine density in Golgi-stained brain sections.\"\n\nFig. 5, lrrtm3-KO mice have reduced excitatory synapse density in the DG, but not the CA1 Region of the Hippocampus\nLiteral:\n\"Moreover, electron microscopy analyses showed that the number of dendritic spines (i.e., asymmetric\/excitatory synapses) in the DG middle molecular layer (MLL) was modestly, but significantly, decreased at P14 and P42 in Lrrtm3-KO mice (Figures 5A–5C, S5A, and S5B). This reduction in excitatory synapse density at the ultrastructural level was not observed in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of Lrrtm3-KO mice (Figures 5A–5C). In contrast, the number of GABA-positive presynaptic\nboutons (i.e., symmetric\/inhibitory synapse) in the DG was not reduced in Lrrtm3-KO mice (Figures 5D–5F). The thickness and length of excitatory PSD- or GABA-positive boutons were unchanged by ablation of LRRTM3 protein (Figures 5D–5F). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the loss of LRRTM3 protein decreases the number of excitatory synapses in vivo without altering their gross ultrastructure.\"\n\nFig. 6, the lrrtm3-KO Mice shows  Impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in DG granule neurons\nLiteral\n\"To determine whether excitatory synaptic function is changed as a result of genetic perturbation of LRRTM3, we performed whole-cell recordings from DG granule cells in hippocampal slices from WT and Lrrtm3-KO mice (Figure 6). We found that the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was markedly reduced in LRRTM3-deficient neurons (Figures 6A–6C). The amplitude of spontaneous excitatory events (sEPSCs) was reduced to the same extent in Lrrtm3-KO neurons (Figures 6D and 6E). Strikingly, the frequency of mEPSCs was significantly increased in neurons from Lrrtm3-KO mice compared with those from WT mice, whereas the frequency of sEPSCs was not altered (Figures 6A–6E). No changes were observed in the frequency or amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (Figures 6D and 6F).\""

In response to synaptic stimulation and NMDA receptor activation, cortactin redistributes rapidly from spines to dendritic shaft, correlating with remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, implicating cortactin in the activity-dependent regulation of spine morphogenesis.\"\n\nThus, cortactin seems implicated in spine morphology maintenance and activity-induced reorganization. Therefore, I chose the GO term \"regulation of synapse organization\" to combine these two functions."

GST-reactive antibodies were removed on a column containing immobilised GST. Antibodies, specific for the C-terminal 21 amino acids of the CRT were affinity-purified on a column containing immobilised GST fusion protein (GST-CC2) and stored (0.5 mg\/mL) in phosphate buffer (−80 °C). The affinity-purified CRT antibodies recognise a ∼70 kDa glycoprotein in membranes from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, transiently or stably expressing the CRT and also showed strong staining of the plasma membrane of these cells by immunofluorescence microscopy.\" No KO control."

The authors hypothsize on a funcitonal relation; \"The analysis of synapse formation with reference to perineuronal nets expression can provide important hints about how extracellular matrix helps to consolidate single cells in neuronal networks. In this work we have demonstrated that PNN-positive neurons host less VGlut1 terminals than PNN-negative ones, and thus form less completed excitatory synapses (Fig. 3A). This finding can be explained by the known capacity of PNNs to restrict synapse formation in mature neurons (Wang and Fawcett, 2012).\" I agree to annotation to perisynaptic ECM based on this data."

DSI is fully blocked by cell-permeant CB1 antagonists (AM251) but only partially blocked by cell-impermeant CB1 antagonists (hemopressin) (Figure 6A), indicating a contribution of mtCB1 activation in DSI. In addition, suppression similar to the one obtained by DSI is found only with cell-permeant agonists of CB1 (HU210) but not with cell-impermeant versions (biotinylated-HU210). Also, HU210 occludes DSI completely, whereas biotinylated-HU210 only occludes it partially, suggesting again a contribution of mtCB1 activation for DSI (Figure 6C). mtCB1 activation also results in reduced mitochondrial respiration and, additionally, direct inhibition of complex I activity using rotenone also mimics DSI, suggesting that endocannabinoid-induced DSI depends on mitochondrial respiration, which would be controlled by mtCB1 (Figure 7)."

In the targeting vector, the STOP codon in the last coding exon (exon 12) of the VGLUT1 gene was replaced in-frame by a venus-loxP-neor-loxP cassette using recombineering techniques with engineered primers. The Venus cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. A. Miyawaki (RIKEN, Wako, Japan), and the recombineering toolbox was provided by Dr. N. Copeland (NCI, Frederick, MD). The venus-loxP-neor-loxP cassette was inserted between a 6.7 kb genomic sequence in 5′ position and a 7.9 kb genomic sequence in 3′ position (Fig. 1C). Mice carrying the mutated VGLUT1VenusNeo gene (VGLUT1vn\/+) were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (SV129\/ola) as described previously (Thomas and Capecchi, 1987; Augustin et al., 1999) and identified by Southern blotting or PCR (Fig. 1D,E). To eliminate deleterious effects of the neomycin resistance gene, we crossed heterozygous VGLUT1vn\/+ mice with EIIa-cre mice that express Cre recombinase in early embryonic stages (Lakso et al., 1996). Successfully recombined VGLUT1Venus alleles (v\/+) in offspring from these interbreedings were genotyped by PCR (Fig. 1D). Except for initial comparative analyses of VGLUT1VenusNeo and VGLUT1Venus mice (Fig. 1), Cre recombined VGLUT1Venus mice were used for all experiments. All experiments were performed with littermates derived from crossing heterozygous VGLUT1v\/+ or homozygous VGLUT1v\/v mice (F2 SV129\/ola × C57BL\/6 genetic background). All live imaging experiments were performed on VGLUT1v\/v mice. The probe used for embryonic stem (ES) cell screening by Southern blot was amplified from the VGLUT1 locus. It is located on the mouse chromosome 7 contig NT_039424.7 at position 6081938–6082223. The following oligonucleotides were used for genotyping PCRs: 9420, CTGGCTGGCAGTGACGAAAG; 9421, CGCTCAGGCTAGAGGTGTATGGA; 9423, CTTCAAGATCCGCCACAACATCG; 4174, CGCATCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTT. Oligonucleotides 9420 and 9421 were used to amplify the WT VGLUT1 allele, oligonucleotides 9421 and 9423 were used to amplify the VGLUT1v allele, and oligonucleotides 9421 and 4174 were used to amplify the VGLUT1vn allele.\n\n(Herzog et. al.

DSI is lost in CB1 knockout mice (Figure 1C,D).

Glycinergic neurotransmission is acutely reduced when presynaptic surface glycine reuptake by GLYT2 is inhibited pharmacologically (ORG25543). IPSC amplitudes ran down soon after drug application (Fig. 2A), declining to 59 ± 11% of baseline within 10–11 min and 3 ± 1% of baseline within 30 min of drug application. Figure 2E: adding exogenous glycine to the whole-cell internal solution in the presynaptic cell occluded the rundown caused by GlyT2 block, showing that the ORG25543 effect was specifically due to loss of glycine availability in the presynaptic terminal. These results show that GLYT2 constitutively supplies glycine for refilling recycling vesicles."

The initial rate of decay of the capacitance change was significantly slower (~33% of control) in the Actin, Gamma KO suggesting a slower rate of endocytosis following vesicle fusion (Fig 2. A-C).    Similar results were observed when the stimulus was changed to a 20 action potential equivalent stimulus (Fig. 2 D-F), performed at 34-37 oC (Fig. 2 G) and in older mice (P13-P14) (Fig. 2 H).\n\nHippocampal neurons were cultured from the Actg LoxP\/LoxP mice transfected with Synaptophysin-pHluorin2X (SypH) with or without a Cre containing plasmid (Fig. 6 A and D).  SypH can be used to study vesicle recycling as it is non-fluorescent in relatively low pH environment of vesicles but is fluorescent in the higher pH extracellular environment.  Upon stimulation the decay of fluorescence was significantly slower than the control (Fig. 6 E-G).  This fluorescence was quenchable by a low pH solution applied externally indicating it was not a deficit in vesicle reacidification, but instead suggesting that the vesicles had not been endocytosed (Fig. 6H).  This effect was rescued by transfecting Actg in the KO cultures (Fig 7 A,B). Taken together this data suggests that Actin, Gamma is important for endocytosis.      \n\n."

Endogenous mGluR7 can be immunoprecipitated from cultured cerebellar granule cells and MacMARCKs can be co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5a). Overexpression of myc-tagged mGluR7 and GFP-tagged MacMARCKS in cultured cerebellar granule cells induces localization of both proteins to the plasma membrane of the soma and dendrites as assessed by ICC (Fig. 5f). Expression of a mGluR7 mutant devoid of the binding domain to MacMARCKS (mGluR7(ΔMacMARCKS) causes a retention of MacMARCKS in the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 5g). \n\nmGluR7 is involved in promoting G-protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). Co-expression of mGluR7A and MacMARCKS in cultured cerebellar granule cells strongly reduces tonic inhibition of VSCCs (Fig. 6b1) indicating an indirect role of MacMARCKS for the regulation of voltage-cated calcium channel activity.\n\nAntibody for WB was generated using purified GST-MacMARCKS fusion protein. Authors specify that the antibody was \"not optimal for immunofluorescent labelling\", therefore GFP-tagged MacMARCKS was overexpressed in cells for ICC.

Figure 5a shows that a current can be elicited when the cesium is replaced by Na+, in the presence of 1, or 3 microMol Ca2+ in the external solution. When no Ca2+ is present at the external solution, no current is elicited, indicating a requirement of Ca2+ at the cytoplasmic domain of the exchanger.\nFigure 5b shows that when the Ca2+ is removed from the external solution, the current decays.\nFigure 5d shows the IV curve for the exchanger.\n\nThe data presented indicates a function for NCX2 as a Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger that is dependent on the ion gradients."

Figure 2 demonstrates that COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA coding for the Mu-type opioid receptor can bind [3H]Diprenorphine (an opioid receptor agonist) in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Cells transfected with the empty vector show no binding.\nFigure 3  presents displacement experiments of [3H]Diprenorphine binding by various unlabeled ligands. Table 1 presents lC50 values calculated based on the efficiency of displacement. DAGO, a mu-type selective agonist was the most efficient in displacing [3H]Diprenorphine binding, whereas kappa-type selective ligands (e.g. U-50488) or delta-type selective (e.g. DSLET) were inefficient in displacing. \nFigure 4 demonstrated that the activity of the receptor is coupled to intracellular signaling: cAMP levels were measured in COS-7 cells expressing the receptor or in non-transfected COS-7 cells. The cells were stimulated with the adenylyl cyclase activator Forskolin and in parallel with the mu-type receptor agonist DAGO. This combination lead to a circa 20% reduction in the cAMP levels. The effect was blocked by the mu-type selective antagonist naloxonazine. This experiment demonstrates a role for the receptor in intracellular signaling."

Paired whole cell recordings of presynaptic interneurons synapsing on pyramidal cells in layer 2\/3 were made. \nIn WT pairs, paired-pulse facilitation of the IPSPs is seen when two depolarizations are given with a 10 Hz frequency (Fig 2A left). After a long recordings, the first IPSC is increased in amplitude and the PPF is reduced (Figure 2A right and 2B left). \nIn calbindin KOs, the first IPSC amplitude is increased already at the start of the recordings, the initial PPF is reduced (2C left and 2B right), and there is no change following long recordings (2B left).\nThese data suggest that in WT cells, a Ca2+ buffer in the presynapse limits the size of the first IPSC and leads to a strong PPF. During the long recordings the buffer is washed out into the recording electrode, the first IPSC amplitudes increases in size and the PPF is reduced. \nFigure 2C (right) shows that calbindin loading in the presynaptic compartment of the knockout interneuron reduces the amplitude of first IPSP and restores facilitation. There is little effect of the loading in WT synapses.\nFigure 3 A and B show similar effects on the initial IPSC amplitude and on the PPR when loading a WT terminal where the endogenous Ca2+ buffer has been washed out with the fast Ca2+-buffer BAPTA.\nTaken together, these data demonstrate a role for calbindin as a Ca2+ buffer regulating presynaptic Ca2+ concentrations, basal release probability and short-term synaptic plasticity at the presynapse of interneurons.\n\nIn figure 5 and 6 similar effects are documented in CA3 mossy fiber calbindin KO synapses."

The reaction product was sedimented, so that the linear, unbundled F-actin stays in supernatant but bundled F-actin sediments.  CaMKIIb was pulled-down with the bundled F-actin while the  CaMKIIalpha stayed in the supernatant, indicating an interaction between bundled F-actin and CaMKIIb. \n\nFigure 1b shows a dose-dependent bundling of F-actin by CaMKIIb.\n\nFigure 1c shows negatively stained electron micrographs of F-actin in the presence or absence of purified CaMKIIalpha or CaMKIIb.

FRAP (fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay in organotypic hippocampal slices was used to monitor the turnover of actin molecules in dendritic spines. CaMKIIb and GFP-actin were overexpressed. This likely results in CaMKII oligomers that are rich in CaMKIIb. GFP-actin in a single dendritic spine was photobleached and thereafter the recovery of its fluorescence was monitored (Fig. 4a-c). The over expression of CaMKIIb lead to a significantly slower turnover of GFP-actin. CaMKIIalpha, and a deletion mutant of CaMKIIb that does not contain the actin binding site did not have an effect on the recovery time constant (Fig. 4D, E).

This effect was also found in hippocampal neurons from acute rat brain slices. Moreover, WB analysis revealed an slight enrichment of Abi-1 in the nuclear fraction upon NMDA treatment. Nuclear translocation was prevented by treatment with colchicine or cytochalasinD, which suggests that the transport depends on microtubules and microfilaments. Nuclear entry seems to rely on Abi-1 phosphorylation of Y53 while synaptic localization seems to rely on the SH3 domain. \nFinally,  Abi-1 influences transcriptional activity at the E-box regulated promoters in HeLa cells after EGF stimulation as part of a complex with Myc\/Max."

AIDA-1 enters the nucleus in response to activity, and this is only prevented by blockade of NMDA receptors, which suggest that NMDA receptor activation triggers AIDA-1 nuclear translocation. Nevertheless, this translocation seems to be independent of intracellular calcium. Upon NMDA receptor activation, AIDA-1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage and the N terminus of the protein shuttles to the nucleus where the C terminus remains as observed by WB using antibodies specific for both protein regions. In this way,the N terminal region is enriched in the nuclear fraction while the C terminus is enriched in the PSD fraction. \nsiRNA-mediated reduction of AIDA-1 levels significatively reduced protein translation induced by Bicuculine, in agreement with a role of  AIDA-1 in regulating nuclear protein synthesis."

                        "rationale": "The paper describes a negative signaling pathway induced by Met-enkephalin, a peptide that binds to the Mu-type opioid-receptor and is produced by the cleavage of Proenkephalin-A and stored in synaptic LDCVs (see CC annotation 963).\n\nThe paper characterizes the dopamine-induced release of the LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) in the postal MBH (a hypothalamic subcompartment). Figure 1 presents an experiment, where the release of LHRH is monitored, with and without the addition of external Dopamine or external Met- enkephalin. The addition of Dopamine increases LHRH release, while the addition of Met- enkephalin has no effect. The combined addition of Dopamine and Met- enkephalin inhibits the Dopamine-dependent augmentation of LHRH release. \n\nIn Figure 2, Naloxone, an Opioid receptor antagonist, is added in parallel to Met- enkephalin and dopamine, and the effect of Met- enkephalin on Dopamine-dependent augmentation of LHRH release is blocked, indicating that the effect is via opioid receptors.\n\nSince Met- enkephalin by itself does not negatively interfere with LHRH release, a possible interpretation of these observations is that Met- enkephalin signaling negatively interferes with the effect of Dopamine-mediated signaling.\n\n23\/8\/2017 Pim\n- Authors state in the Intro \"Dopamine (DA) has been found to simulate the release of LHRH from ... a synaptosomal fraction of the MBH (Bennett et al., Nature 257, 323 (1975))\" This shows that the dopamine (exogenously applied in the primary paper) is released from synapses. We can file the data in this paper under 'synaptic signaling'."

Treatment with Bicuculine to increase network activity induced a reduction of RNF-10 immunoreactivity in synapses and a simultaneous enhancement in the nucleus. This effect is nicely monitored by using an photo convertible RNF-10, which is photo converted in distal dendrites upon application of bicuculine and whose fluorescence can be observe in the nucleus over time. Translocation of RNF10 is dependent on activation of synaptic NMDA receptors.\nInterestingly, RNF10 can interact with importins alpha, and bicuculin treatment enhanced the interaction between RNF10 and importin alpha1, suggesting an importin-dependent nuclear translocation of RNF10. \nPhotoconversion experiments performed after induction of LTP using field stimulation reveals that RNF10 accumulated in the nucleus after long distance protein transport. This was corroborated using a different approach in which levels of RNF10 in the nuclear fraction were assessed after induction of cLTP in primary hippocampal cultures, which revealed an enrichment of RNF10. Finally, downregulation of RNF10 levels by means of a shRNA revealed that lacking of RNF10 prevented expression of target genes such as p21waf\/cip1 and Ophn1."

Confocal imaging revealed that cortactin immunoreactivity is localized apposed to the presynaptic protein synaptophysin and Vglut, which suggests its presence in the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses. Co-staining with a lipophilic dye that labels plasma membrane revealed the accumulation of cortactin in dendritic spines. Electron microscopy with immunoperoxidase labeling of cortactin revealed staining in dendrites which was denser within dendritic spines below PSDs, confirming the localization of cortactin within spines. In order to gain insight into the precise location of the protein, immunogold EM was performed. In agreement with previous results, immunogold labeling was prominent in spines, usually associated with electron-dense filaments, which suggests interaction with cytoskeleton. Analysis of the distribution of the immunogold particles within the spines revealed that these are localized 100-150nm away from the synapse, in the spine core.\n\n11\/8\/2017 Pim\n- Based on prior knowledge of Cortactin and the statement \"... usually associated with electron-dense filaments...\" I allow annotation to the term  'postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton (GO:0098871)' without an IC construct."

Subsequent pre-embedding immunoEM performed in hippocampal sections revealed CNA gamma immunoreactivity in the presynaptic compartment, in the vicinity of synaptic vesicles. This was supported by post-embedding immunogold EM, which also revealed the presence of the protein in the cytosol of the presynaptic compartment."

Analysis of endocytosis kinetics, however, revealed a significant decrease of the time constant of fluorescence recovery, tau, which was rescued by over expression of a shRNA resistant CNA gamma vector. Analysis of the reacidification kinetics discarded an impairment of vesicle reacidification and supported the role of CNA gamma in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.

HRP signal is used to mark the presynaptic compartment, so that the localization of Wg in both the pre- and postsynaptic compartments can be made, and quantification is presented in \nfigure 1E.

This leads to a rescue of the Wg signal in both presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic muscle (quantification in 1E). The postsynaptic expression of Wls\/Evi in the muscle (1D) does not lead to rescue.\n\nFigure 5 shows using electron microscopy that Wls\/Ewi can move between the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. GFP-tagged Wls\/Evi was expressed in motorneurons. Anti-GFP labelling shows that the GFP signal can be found also at the postsynaptic muscle (5D). Expression of GFP-tagged Wls\/Evi in the presynaptic neurons on the KO background had a similar effect: GFP-Wls\/Evi could be found not only in the neurons but also at the postsynaptic muscle and at the synaptic cleft (5I, J, K).\n\nTaken together, the paper shows that Wls\/Evi is important for the localization or secretion of the signaling molecule Wg, and that Wls\/Evi is able to move across the synaptic cleft.\n\n3\/2\/2017 Pim\n- The method of Evi\/Wntless mediating signals from pre- to post-synapse is different from what I initially thought based on this description.

The data shows that CDC42 knockdown affects the sustained response selectively, and this can can be rescued by expression of shRNA resistant CDC42 (Fig 3E, F, I and J).

DSI is lost in CB1 knockout mice (Figure 1C,D). Additionally, DSE is lost in CB1 knockout mice (Figure 8A of Ohno-Shosaku, T. et al (2002) J Neurosci, 22(10), 3864-3872). \n\nFigure 3: In addition, evidence is shown that presynaptic N-Type Ca2+ channels are required for endocannabinoid signaling. DSI is occluded by a specific antagonist of N-type channels, ω-conotoxin GVIA, indicating a presynaptic requirement for N-type calcium channels in the regulation of GABAergic transmission by cannabinoids. Conversely, blocking P\/Q-type channels results in increased DSI (removes a component of GABA release that is insensitive to DSI and therefore modulation of N-type calcium channels by cannabinoids is now very relevant)."

BRAG1 overexpression increases surface expression levels of GluA2 (Fig. 6), but overexpression or KD of BRAG1 has no effect on LTP generation at the CA3-CA1 SC synapse (Fig.9). However, KD of BRAG1 affects LTD indicating that removal of AMPA receptors is affected in the absence of BRAG1 and this effect depends on the enzymatic Arf-GEF activity of BRAG1 (Fig.10).\n\nIn summary, these data indicate that BRAG1 modulates the expression levels of AMPA receptors at postsynapses."

This is based on measurements of the ATPase activity of the trimeric complex and the refolding of a model substrate firefly luciferase. Comparing these activities imparted by individual or pairwise mixes of the components highlights the synergistic activity of the trimeric complex. The important evidence in terms of the synaptic localization is that the pool of the largely cytoplasmic SGT-alpha that is bound to synaptic vesicles is lost when these organelles are made from CSP alpha knockout mouse. These observations are critically dependent on a SGT-alpha antibody whose specificity is defined by a lack of immunoreactivity in pre-immune sera."

In CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral synapses of the hippocampus, beta1-ARs are selectively involved in the generation of late-LTP in a PKA-dependant manner and via activation of ERK. \n\nTo induce robust LTP, a protocol was chosen in which prolonged (3min) 5Hz stimulation is paired with beta-AR activation by application of 1 µM Iso (Fig. 2A). The induction of this form of LTP is dependent on beta1-AR activation since it is abolished in beta1-KO and beta1\/beta2-DKO mice (Fig.2C), but not in beta2-KO mice (Fig. 2D). Basal synaptic transmission in beta1-KO mice is normal (Fig. 2E) indicating a selective effect during LTP generation. This form of LTP is further dependent on PKA since LTP is reduced in the presence of the PKA-inhibitor KT5720 (Fig. 3A) and depends on activation of ERK, since inhibition of ERK by the use of MEK inhibitors (e.g. U0126; Fig. 3B) also reduces LTP. \n\nMEK inhibitors did not change fEPSP slopes (Fig. 4D), indicating that beta-AR activation by Iso does not transiently enhance presynaptic synaptic transmission. In contrast, during the 5 Hz stimulation, postsynaptic CA1 neurons are known to generate AP firing patterns and application of Iso during the tetanus increases the number of postsynaptic spikes (Fig. 5A, B, E). \n\nThese findings indicate that beta1-AR activation enhances LTP generation via postsynaptic signaling pathways that enhance neuronal excitability.\n\n17\/8\/2017 Pim\n-  The effect on \"neuronal excitability\" is translated into the term 'regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential'."

Analysis of the inhibitory synaptic currents revealed that this increase in mIPSP amplitude is due to a increase number of channels in the cell surface. In line with this, cell surface biotynilation revealed an increased surface expression of the beta3 subunit of the channel.

Expression of a dominant negative version of Rab35 in sky mutants abolishes these structures and restores FM1-43 to a wildtype like distribution, indicating that Skywalker functions to regulate Rab35-mediate trafficking to these structures. Sorting of synaptic membranes as visualised by using an artificial chimeric version of synaptobrevin as ESCRT cargo revealed that levels of this cargo is significantly reduced as compared to wild type animals (Fig 7). Taken together, the results indicate that Rab35 is responsible for directing a subpopulation of synaptic vesicle proteins and membrane for sorting and\/or degradation via synaptic endosomes."

Pull-down from heterologous cell expression and also cerebellar and cortex extracts also show that Shank3 can interact directly with mGluR1\/5 (and also indirectly with Homer1). Altogether, these publications showing the interaction  with PSD95\/GKAP and Homer\/mGluR1\/5 point to Shanks being a postsynaptic scaffold protein, which also couples NMDAR and mGluR signaling."

Application of adenosine caused an inhibition of evoked inhibitory responses that is mediated by A1 receptors that could be blocked by co-application of the A3R agonist Cl-IB-MECA (Fig. 3c). This effect could be blocked by the A3 antagonist MRS 1191 (Fig. 4b).\n\n17\/8\/2017 Pim\n- The effect on SV exocytosis may be indirect as stated in the discussion: \"The present studies have demonstrated that selective activation or antagonism of adenosine A3 receptors alone has no direct effect on synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus. However, activation of these receptors reduces the sensitivity of presynaptic A1 receptors that inhibit glutamate release in this preparation, whereas responses to other presynaptic modulators at these synapses are unaffected. Based on these results, we hypothesize that an important role of A3receptors in brain may be to regulate the level of sensitivity of A1 receptors, which normally are tonically activated by low concentrations of endogenous adenosine.\""

Immuno-depletion of neuronal+ubiquitous AP-3 from this assay (neuronal+unibuitous) shows the same 50% reduction.\nFig.3: removal of neuronal AP-3 complexes (beta3B-adaptin immunodepleted cytosol) reduces SV budding with 50%. These data strongly suggest that synaptic vesicle budding from endosomes is attributable solely to the neuronal form of the AP-3 complex.\nFig.4: the neuronal AP-3 is not the major form of AP-3 in brain.\n\nConclusions:\n- The neuronal AP-3 complex that contains beta3B-adaptin is shown to be involved in SV budding from endosomes.\n- Based on these experiments it is unclear whether the beta3B-adaptin-containing neuronal AP-3 complex also contains the mu3B-adaptin subunit. The mu3B-adaptin KO is used as an apporach that removes all AP-3 subunits.\n\n-++ Possible annotations:\n- DIRECT: beta3B-adaptin --> SV budding from endosome\n- INFERRED: delta-adaptin --> SV budding from endosome (based on fixed participation in AP-3 complexes)\n\nProblematic annotations:\n- sigma3A\/sigma3B-adaptin: the experimental show effect of 'sigma3' depletion on SV budding, but do not distinguish between sigma3A\/sigma3B-adaptin genes (literal: \"pan-ς3 antibodies were prepared against GST fusion protein composed of residues 16–180 of ς3B\")\n- mu3A\/mu3B-adaptin: experiments do not show role of mu3A-adaptin and\/or mu3B-adaptin in SV budding."

Utilizing an antibody, whose molecular determinants are not well described, they show excellent specificity utilizing loss of immunoreactivity in western blots, histology and electron microscopy performed with knockout tissue. These antibodies are used in super-resolution immunofluorescence and quantitative immunoglold electron microscopy to show PCDH17 is concentrated in synaptic specialization at the periphery of the active zone and the postsynaptic density on both sides of the synapse. This is true at both the excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The knock-out animals allow investigation of synaptic function and the best evidence is that genetic deletion leads to a reorganization of pre-synaptic vesicles, which in the paper focuses on excitatory synapses. These morphological data hint at an increase in vesicle numbers and this is consistent with the modest reduction in the rate synaptic depression in the PCDH-17 knock out animals relative to the control."

Small (0.5 0.5 mm) blocks from CA1 were freeze substituted, sectioned, and immunolabeled as described previously (Mathiisen et al., 2006). For double immuno- gold labeling, the sections were first incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-PICK1 followed by goat anti-rabbit coupled to 20-nm colloidal gold. The sections were exposed to formaldehyde vapor at 80 C for 1 h and thereafter incu- bated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GluA2, followed by goat anti-rabbit coupled to 10-nm colloidal gold.

For bright field light microscopy the rats were perfused as above, but glutaraldehyde was omitted from the fixative. Vibratome sections were cut from whole brain tissue.\nElectron microscopy quantification and statistical an- alysis. Electron micrographs of asymmetric structurally defined synapses were obtained randomly from the middle layer of the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Schaffer collateral synapses). Images of 60 synapses from each animal were selected for analysis; each showed intact plasma membranes, presynaptic vesicles and a clear synaptic cleft. GluA2 immunolabeling was quantified as number of gold particles\/lm (linear density) of membrane length or as number of gold particles\/lm2 (area density) for regions of interests in the intracellular compartment in asymmetric synapses.",
